# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection using Deep Learning
## 📋 Overview

This project presents a deep learning-based brain tumor detection system that analyzes MRI or X-ray images to determine whether a tumor is present or not, along with a confidence score for prediction accuracy.

The model was developed and trained in Google Colab using TensorFlow and Keras, leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for high-accuracy medical image classification.

🔗 I’ve also developed a mobile application using this trained model!

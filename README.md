# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection using Deep Learning
📋 Overview

This project is a deep learning-based brain tumor detection model that analyzes X-ray or MRI images and predicts whether a tumor is present or not, along with the confidence score of the prediction.

The model was developed and trained in Google Colab using TensorFlow and Keras, leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for accurate medical image classification.

🚀 Key Features

🩺 Tumor Detection – Classifies input brain X-ray/MRI as Tumor or No Tumor.

📊 Confidence Score – Displays prediction probability for transparency.

☁️ Google Colab Integration – Easy to train and test in the cloud.

📁 Custom Dataset Support – Can be trained with any labeled brain image dataset.

🔍 Model Export – Supports .h5 or .tflite export for mobile/web integration.
